Adds ProofAge-powered age verification to WordPress and WooCommerce storefronts.

== Description ==

ProofAge Age Verification integrates the hosted ProofAge verification flow with WordPress and WooCommerce.

With this plugin you can:

* protect the full site or selected WordPress pages and post categories
* protect WooCommerce products and product categories
* block add-to-cart, cart, checkout, and Store API flows until verification is complete
* show a full-page gate or a blocking overlay, depending on the protected content
* store a verification snapshot on WooCommerce orders and show it in the admin order details panel
* localize gate copy and pass the supported storefront language to ProofAge when creating a verification

The plugin uses the hosted ProofAge flow and webhooks together with browser-side return reconciliation and status polling.

External service disclosure:

* this plugin requires a ProofAge account and valid API credentials
* it connects to the ProofAge API to create verifications, fetch verification status, and process signed webhook callbacks
* when a shopper starts verification, the plugin sends limited verification request data to ProofAge, such as an external identifier, callback or return URL, supported storefront language, and verification-related metadata
* the plugin stores limited verification state locally in WordPress and WooCommerce, including verification status, verification ID, external ID, return URL, timestamps, session token, and optional order verification metadata

Supported browser flows:

* open the hosted verification in an iframe modal on the current page
* redirect in the current window
* open the hosted verification in a new tab

This version intentionally does not support:

* a custom in-page ProofAge capture UI
* theme-specific quick-view integrations beyond the generic add-to-cart interception hooks

== Installation ==

1. Upload the proofage-age-verification folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, or install the plugin through WordPress.
2. Activate ProofAge Age Verification in the WordPress admin.
3. Go to Settings -> ProofAge Verification.
4. Enter your ProofAge API key and secret key.
5. Configure launch mode, gate texts, verification TTL, and protection scope.
6. Set the ProofAge webhook URL to https://your-store.example/wp-json/proofage/v1/webhook.
7. Make sure ProofAge can return to https://your-store.example/?proofage-return=1.

The plugin automatically appends an origin query parameter so shoppers can be returned to the page where they started verification.
